# VSR-ReversePolishTests
Lots of math stuff I used for the VSR Item Rando

This project is filled to the brim with hair-brained functions, orphaned properties, and lots and lots and lots of unhinged craziness. Please excuse the mess, but it helped me develop a tiny branch of mathematics required to allow the randomizer to finish before the heat-death of the universe- among other tests. Of particular note is the [Positive Logic Minimizer](https://github.com/SloanReynolds/VSR-ReversePolishTests/tree/main/DapperLogic/PositiveLogicMinimizer). As far as I could tell, this particular optimization of this particular subset of the Quine McClusky algorithm was hitherto undiscovered (particularly).
